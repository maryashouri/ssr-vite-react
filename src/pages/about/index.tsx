        # Functional Requirements **As a** user, **I want** to see a list of
        hotels in Tehran within the application, **So that** I can view a brief
        overview of each hotel and its location. ### Acceptance Criteria -
        **Filtering**: Users can filter hotels by searching for part of the
        hotel name or description. - **Detailed View**: Users can view detailed
        information about a hotel on a separate page, including all details and
        user comments. - **Map Integration**: Users can see all hotels in Tehran
        on a map and select a hotel to view its information. --- #
        Non-Functional Requirements - **Performance**: The application must
        achieve high Core Web Vitals scores. - **Architecture**: It should be a
        Progressive Web App (PWA) that utilizes the PRPL pattern. -
        **Server-Side Rendering**: The application must support Server-Side
        Rendering (SSR) with E-tags for efficient browser caching. - **Type
        Safety**: The project must prioritize high type safety. - **Code
        Quality**: Adherence to SOLID principles and clean code is essential. -
        **Frameworks**: No SSR frameworks must be used. - **Optimization**:
        Optimize React re-rendering cycles to the greatest extent possible. -
        **Testing**: Implement unit tests across the application. -
        **Deployment**: Include a Dockerfile for deployment. --- ## Additional
        Notes - You are free to use any UI and Map library that meets your
        needs. - Utilize
        [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) for the backend
        API. Each hotel should adhere to the following object structure: -
        Minimal UI design is required; therefore, CSS and styling issues can be
        deferred. --- ## Bonuses - Implement GitLab CI or GitHub Actions for
        continuous integration. - Include a deployment YAML file for Kubernetes.
        - Use React Query or any equivalent for data fetching.
